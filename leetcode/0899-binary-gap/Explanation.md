## Problem
Given a positive integer  n , find and return  the  longest distance  between any two  adjacent    1  &#39;s in the binary representation of   n  . If there are no two adjacent   1  &#39;s, return   0  .

## Key Insight
Leverage **Bit Manipulation** with **Integer Bitmask** to process inputs efficiently and achieve optimal time and space complexity.

## Approach
We iterate through the input using **Bitwise Masking & Bit Shift**. By maintaining state efficiently in a **Integer Bitmask**, we eliminate redundant operations and process each element in optimal time.

## Algorithm
1. Initialize state variables / data structure (**Integer Bitmask**).
2. Process elements sequentially using **Bitwise Masking & Bit Shift**.
3. Validate boundary conditions and return optimal result.

## Example
Consider the standard input for **Binary Gap**. Applying **Bitwise Masking & Bit Shift** yields the target result step by step.

## Complexity
- **Time Complexity:** O(n)
- **Space Complexity:** O(1)

## Pattern
**Bit Manipulation**

## Topics
- Bit Manipulation
- Bitwise Math

## Language
Python

## Source Code
- [solution.py](./solution.py)

## Why This Works
By utilizing **Bit Manipulation**, each element is processed efficiently, ensuring optimal performance while avoiding unnecessary re-computations.

## Common Mistakes
1. Missing edge cases (empty inputs, boundary limits, negative values).
2. Off-by-one errors in loop conditions.
3. TLE due to suboptimal data structure choices.
