## Problem
You are given an integer array  nums  of length  n  and an integer array  queries .

## Key Insight
Break down the main problem into overlapping subproblems, storing optimal intermediate states in a DP table or memoization array to avoid re-computation.

## Approach
We iterate through the input using **Memoization / Bottom-Up State Transition**. By maintaining state efficiently in a **DP Table / Array**, we eliminate redundant operations and process each element in optimal time.

## Algorithm
1. Initialize state variables / data structure (**DP Table / Array**).
2. Process elements sequentially using **Memoization / Bottom-Up State Transition**.
3. Validate boundary conditions and return optimal result.

## Example
Consider the standard input for **Count Special Triplets**. Applying **Memoization / Bottom-Up State Transition** yields the target result step by step.

## Complexity
- **Time Complexity:** O(n)
- **Space Complexity:** O(n)

## Pattern
**Dynamic Programming**

## Topics
- Dynamic Programming
- Memoization
- State Transition

## Language
PHP

## Source Code
- [solution.php](./solution.php)

## Why This Works
By utilizing **Dynamic Programming**, each element is processed efficiently, ensuring optimal performance while avoiding unnecessary re-computations.

## Common Mistakes
1. Incorrect base case initialization.
2. Flawed state transition equation.
3. Storing unnecessary state leading to Memory Limit Exceeded (MLE).

## Interview Notes
- **Tests:** Subproblem decomposition, state transition logic, and space optimization.
- **Follow-up:** Can space complexity be reduced from $O(n^2)$ to $O(n)$ or $O(1)$?
