## Problem
Given a string  s  which consists of lowercase or uppercase letters, return the length of the  longest  palindrome   that can be built with those letters.

## Key Insight
Use two pointers moving toward each other or in parallel to process elements in a single pass without quadratic nested loops.

## Approach
We iterate through the input using **Two Pointer Convergence & Scanning**. By maintaining state efficiently in a **Array**, we eliminate redundant operations and process each element in optimal time.

## Algorithm
1. Initialize state variables / data structure (**Array**).
2. Process elements sequentially using **Two Pointer Convergence & Scanning**.
3. Validate boundary conditions and return optimal result.

## Example
Consider the standard input for **Longest Palindrome**. Applying **Two Pointer Convergence & Scanning** yields the target result step by step.

## Complexity
- **Time Complexity:** O(n)
- **Space Complexity:** O(1)

## Pattern
**Two Pointers**

## Topics
- Two Pointers
- Array
- Sorting

## Language
Python

## Source Code
- [solution.py](./solution.py)

## Why This Works
By utilizing **Two Pointers**, each element is processed efficiently, ensuring optimal performance while avoiding unnecessary re-computations.

## Common Mistakes
1. Failing to sort the array when ordering is required.
2. Not skipping duplicate elements leading to non-unique pairs.
3. Pointer out-of-bounds errors on edge inputs.

## Interview Notes
- **Tests:** In-place array traversal, duplicate elimination, and pointer convergence.
- **Follow-up:** Can this approach be extended to 3Sum or 4Sum variants?
