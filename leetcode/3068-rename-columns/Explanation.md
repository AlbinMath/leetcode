## Problem
Write a solution to rename the columns as follows:

## Key Insight
Leverage **Tree & Graph** with **Tree / Graph / Grid** to process inputs efficiently and achieve optimal time and space complexity.

## Approach
We iterate through the input using **Iterative Traversal**. By maintaining state efficiently in a **Array**, we eliminate redundant operations and process each element in optimal time.

## Algorithm
1. Initialize state variables / data structure (**Tree / Graph / Grid**).
2. Process elements sequentially using **Depth-First Search (DFS) / Breadth-First Search (BFS)**.
3. Validate boundary conditions and return optimal result.

## Example
Consider the standard input for **Find the Maximum Sum of Node Values**. Applying **Depth-First Search (DFS) / Breadth-First Search (BFS)** yields the target result step by step.

## Complexity
- **Time Complexity:** O(n)
- **Space Complexity:** O(n)

## Pattern
**Tree & Graph**

## Topics
- Tree
- Graph
- DFS
- BFS

## Language
Python

## Source Code
- [solution.py](./solution.py)

## Why This Works
By utilizing **Tree & Graph**, each element is processed efficiently, ensuring optimal performance while avoiding unnecessary re-computations.

## Common Mistakes
1. Missing edge cases (empty inputs, boundary limits, negative values).
2. Off-by-one errors in loop conditions.
3. TLE due to suboptimal data structure choices.

## Interview Notes
- **Tests:** Fundamental DSA concepts, problem analysis, and edge-case handling.
- **Follow-up:** How would you scale this solution for large input streams?
