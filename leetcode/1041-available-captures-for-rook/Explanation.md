## Problem
You are given an  8 x 8   matrix  representing a chessboard. There is  exactly one  white rook represented by  &#39;R&#39; , some number of white bishops  &#39;B&#39; , and some number of black pawns  &#39;p&#39; . Empty squares are represented by  &#39;.&#39; .

## Key Insight
Leverage **Array / General** with **Array** to process inputs efficiently and achieve optimal time and space complexity.

## Approach
We iterate through the input using **In-Place Array Traversal & Index Mapping**. By maintaining state efficiently in a **Array**, we eliminate redundant operations and process each element in optimal time.

## Algorithm
1. Initialize state variables / data structure (**Array**).
2. Process elements sequentially using **In-Place Array Traversal & Index Mapping**.
3. Validate boundary conditions and return optimal result.

## Example
Consider the standard input for **Available Captures for Rook**. Applying **In-Place Array Traversal & Index Mapping** yields the target result step by step.

## Complexity
- **Time Complexity:** O(n)
- **Space Complexity:** O(1)

## Pattern
**Array / General**

## Topics
- Array

## Language
Python

## Source Code
- [solution.py](./solution.py)

## Why This Works
By utilizing **Array / General**, each element is processed efficiently, ensuring optimal performance while avoiding unnecessary re-computations.

## Common Mistakes
1. Missing edge cases (empty inputs, boundary limits, negative values).
2. Off-by-one errors in loop conditions.
3. TLE due to suboptimal data structure choices.
