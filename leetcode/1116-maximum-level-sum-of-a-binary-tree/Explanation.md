## Problem
Given the  root  of a binary tree, the level of its root is  1 , the level of its children is  2 , and so on.

## Key Insight
Exploit sorted ordering or monotonic properties to eliminate half of the search space at each step in $O(\log n)$ time.

## Approach
We iterate through the input using **Depth-First Search (DFS) / Breadth-First Search (BFS)**. By maintaining state efficiently in a **Tree / Graph / Grid**, we eliminate redundant operations and process each element in optimal time.

## Algorithm
1. Initialize state variables / data structure (**Sorted Array**).
2. Process elements sequentially using **Modified Binary Search**.
3. Validate boundary conditions and return optimal result.

## Example
Consider the standard input for **Maximum Level Sum of a Binary Tree**. Applying **Modified Binary Search** yields the target result step by step.

## Complexity
- **Time Complexity:** O(n)
- **Space Complexity:** O(1)

## Pattern
**Binary Search**

## Topics
- Binary Search
- Divide and Conquer
- Search Space

## Language
JavaScript

## Source Code
- [solution.js](./solution.js)

## Why This Works
By utilizing **Binary Search**, each element is processed efficiently, ensuring optimal performance while avoiding unnecessary re-computations.

## Common Mistakes
1. Applying standard binary search without accounting for array rotation or duplicates.
2. Off-by-one errors when updating boundary pointers (`left = mid + 1` vs `right = mid - 1`).
3. Integer overflow during midpoint calculation (use `mid = left + (right - left) // 2`).

## Interview Notes
- **Tests:** Logarithmic search space reduction, boundary handling, and invariant preservation.
- **Follow-up:** How does performance change if the array contains duplicate elements?
