## Problem
You are given an integer array  nums . You may  rearrange the elements  in any order.

## Key Insight
Leverage **Tree & Graph** with **Tree / Graph / Grid** to process inputs efficiently and achieve optimal time and space complexity.

## Approach
We iterate through the input using **In-Place Array Traversal & Index Mapping**. By maintaining state efficiently in a **Array**, we eliminate redundant operations and process each element in optimal time.

## Algorithm
1. Initialize state variables / data structure (**Tree / Graph / Grid**).
2. Process elements sequentially using **Depth-First Search (DFS) / Breadth-First Search (BFS)**.
3. Validate boundary conditions and return optimal result.

## Example
Consider the standard input for **Maximum Alternating Sum of Squares**. Applying **Depth-First Search (DFS) / Breadth-First Search (BFS)** yields the target result step by step.

## Complexity
- **Time Complexity:** O(n)
- **Space Complexity:** O(n)

## Pattern
**Tree & Graph**

## Topics
- Tree
- Graph
- DFS
- BFS

## Language
JavaScript

## Source Code
- [solution.js](./solution.js)

## Why This Works
By utilizing **Tree & Graph**, each element is processed efficiently, ensuring optimal performance while avoiding unnecessary re-computations.

## Common Mistakes
1. Missing edge cases (empty inputs, boundary limits, negative values).
2. Off-by-one errors in loop conditions.
3. TLE due to suboptimal data structure choices.

## Interview Notes
