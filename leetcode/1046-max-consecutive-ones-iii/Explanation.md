## Problem
Given a binary array  nums  and an integer  k , return  the maximum number of consecutive   1  &#39;s in the array if you can flip at most   k   0 &#39;s.

## Key Insight
Leverage **Array / General** with **Array** to process inputs efficiently and achieve optimal time and space complexity.

## Approach
We iterate through the input using **In-Place Array Traversal & Index Mapping**. By maintaining state efficiently in a **Array**, we eliminate redundant operations and process each element in optimal time.

## Algorithm
1. Initialize state variables / data structure (**Array**).
2. Process elements sequentially using **In-Place Array Traversal & Index Mapping**.
3. Validate boundary conditions and return optimal result.

## Example
Consider the standard input for **Max Consecutive Ones III**. Applying **In-Place Array Traversal & Index Mapping** yields the target result step by step.

## Complexity
- **Time Complexity:** O(n)
- **Space Complexity:** O(1)

## Pattern
**Array / General**

## Topics
- Array

## Language
JavaScript

## Source Code
- [solution.js](./solution.js)

## Why This Works
By utilizing **Array / General**, each element is processed efficiently, ensuring optimal performance while avoiding unnecessary re-computations.

## Common Mistakes
1. Missing edge cases (empty inputs, boundary limits, negative values).
2. Off-by-one errors in loop conditions.
3. TLE due to suboptimal data structure choices.

## Interview Notes
- **Tests:** Fundamental DSA concepts, problem analysis, and edge-case handling.
- **Follow-up:** How would you scale this solution for large input streams?
